Please complete 1, 2 and 3 below.

1. Please write 100 words on your current project ideas.
                                                                                            
I intend to implement the following components for a subset of Prolog:

- Lexer 
- Parser 
- Translator from parse tree to byte-code 
- Abstract machine to execute this byte-code

The abstract machine and byte-code design will be inspired by an
existing abstract machine specification called the Warren Abstract
Machine (WAM).

I hope to extend the project by adding optimisations to the compiler.
Examples include type checking, mode analysis, and determinacy
analysis. This may require me to modify the Prolog syntax that I use
to include various annotations.

2. Please list names of potential project supervisors.
                                                                 
Prof. Alan Mycroft has agreed to supervise this project.
                                                                 
3. Is there any chance that your project will involve any computing
resources other than the Computing Service's MCS and software that is
already installed there, for example: your own machine, machines in
College, special peripherals, imported software packages, special
hardware, network access, substantial extra disc space on the MCS.

If so indicate below what, and what it is needed for.

I intend to primarily use my own laptop (Dell XPS 15, 16GB RAM,
i7-7700HQ, running Ubuntu). This is, however, only for convenience. I
will back up my work to enable me to switch to using MCS machines in
case of failure of my laptop.
